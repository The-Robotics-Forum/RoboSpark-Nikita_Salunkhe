                    Completed senior project at Siemens Company, a manufacturer of machine tools for the sheet metal industry.
                    Possessing assisted engineering department in designing straight hand seamer used in bending, seaming and flattening sheet metal.
                    Created models using SolidWorks and participated in cross-functional product-development meetings.
                    Contributed idea for change in handle design that is expected to improve comfort and safety when gripping the seamer. 
                    Product is currently in preproduction testing phase.<br><br>

                <p id="project_title_para">
                    Finished the design for motorcycle blinker, working as senior project at Apache Company. Built the CAD in NX 12 and figured 
                    Topology Optimization was a good fit to improve the design, reduce the weight, and improve the strength. Because of the nature of Additive Manufacturing,
                    my team figured the flexibility of 3D printing could make up for its reduced material strength.
